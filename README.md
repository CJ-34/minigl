# miniGL (OpenGL 3D Libray)

A lightweight **3D graphics library** built on modern **OpenGL 3.3+**.  
This project focuses on providing clean abstractions for OpenGL, making it easier to build rendering applications without the full overhead of a game engine.

---

## Current Features

- [x] Shader abstraction (compile, link, and use GLSL programs)  
- [x] Texture handling (2D textures, basic parameters)  
- [x] Mesh abstraction (VAO/VBO/EBO setup)  
- [x] Basic 3D rendering pipeline  

---

## Planned Features

- [ ] Camera utilities (projection & view matrices)  
- [ ] Matrix math helpers (wrapping GLM or custom implementation)  
- [ ] Lighting utilities (directional, point, spot light support)  
- [ ] Model loader (e.g., `.obj` via Assimp)  
- [ ] Cubemap support (skyboxes, environment mapping)  
- [ ] Framebuffer abstraction (post-processing)  
- [ ] Uniform buffer objects (UBOs) for global data  
- [ ] Simple resource manager (shaders, textures, meshes)  
- [ ] ImGui debug overlay integration

## Building

This project uses **CMake**. Example build steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CJ-34/minigl.git
cd minigl
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
